 INTRODUCTION
------------

The Krocodile module provides a Plugin Framework for tracking and displaying the KPI stats for a team.  The plugins can be used to retrieve, process, and render statistics for individuals or on a team level.

Krocodile does not do anything on its own other than allowing you to define arbitrary KPIs, other modules can extend the functionality through KPI Plugins or Report Plugins.
